# FirstCry Landing Page Redesign Task 1 (CodTech Internship)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is part of my **CODTECH Internship** task, where I was required to take an existing website landing page and redesign it to improve **usability** and **aesthetics**.  
I selected **FirstCry** â€” an e-commerce platform for baby and kids' products â€” and created a cleaner, more modern, and user-friendly landing page design.

## ðŸ–¼ Before vs After

### **Before**
- Cluttered layout with multiple banners and promotions competing for attention.
- Heavy use of bright, mismatched colors.
- Inconsistent navigation and unclear visual hierarchy.

### **After**
- Minimal, clean layout with balanced whitespace.
- Pastel color palette to create a calm, child-friendly atmosphere.
- Clear section hierarchy: Hero banner â†’ Category highlights â†’ Product grid â†’ Footer.
- Prominent **Shop Now** CTAs with consistent design.
- Product categories displayed using icons and simple labels.
- Layout optimized for potential mobile adaptation.
