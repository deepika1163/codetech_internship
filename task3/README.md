# 🛒 Amazon App Redesign – Task 3 (CodTech Internship)

## 🔍Pain Points Identified (Before)
1.  **Cluttered Home Screen** – Too many sections and promotions, making it overwhelming for first-time users.  
2.  **Hidden Navigation** – The hamburger menu hides key features like “Orders” and “Account”.  
3.  **Visual Overload** – Multiple font styles, sizes, and colors reduce visual hierarchy.  
4.  **Limited Personalization** – Recommendations are scattered and not prominently displayed.  
5.  **Inefficient Search Bar** – Long and not visually distinct from other elements.
